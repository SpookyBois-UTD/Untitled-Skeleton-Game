This is where the main game loop will lay and the stuff that the player can see will reside in here
After scene (class) is created, a node will can be placed in this main scene for the game
This includes:
	Level
	Skeleton boi
	Enemies
	Items
	Etc.
There is nothing right now, this is just a comment to show what this does since nothing exists in it at the moment
